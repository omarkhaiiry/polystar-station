# Station

This project was created by Omar Khairy for polystar techinacal task
It is a simple web application made with angular to serve MÃ¥rtensdal station and view the trams heading towards it in the direction of Gullmarsplan during the next hour
adding for that a page full of sweden cites to visit and a summery of what this city popular for, and a link to see placews to visit inside this city

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Tips

if no trams found kindly check the source api as it's not stable sometimes returns internal server error and sometimes "Could not retrive information for buses, trains, trams or metro."
